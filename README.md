# Hurricane Insurance DApp

## Overview

This project is a decentralized application (DApp) for Hurricane Insurance, leveraging real-time data to enable automatic payouts without the need for claim filings or wait times. Utilizing Chainlink for secure and reliable external data, the application ensures that policyholders are compensated quickly and accurately in the event of a hurricane.
